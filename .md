1. My website URL is https://donggo-git.github.io/FreeToPlay/
My github URL is https://github.com/donggo-git/FreeToPlay
2. The api I use is RAWG.io because it easy to use. Game also the topic I really interested in, 
but I haven't made any project related to this topic
3. Unfortunately, I don't have much time to build many others functionality for this project.
However, there's a functionality, I created that doesn't have in the instruction which is get user
to the game official website when they click on a specific game. This functionality take little longer
time than regular <a> tag since it has to fetch the API of the game detail to know the game official website. Moreover, I also create the infinite scroll for the website make the user scroll down for infinite with infinite game from the api
4. The first consideration I had is for the Filter component, since the instruction said filter component is in the top component. For that, I did different with the instruction by making the filter component
lying on the left side, which easier for user to look for the game list and filter to find what they want
easier, and also help me easier to change for each screen like PC, iphone, tablet, Samsung Galaxy.
Second, that is the game list. For that I use display grid for it, so that I can modify its column for different screens like 3 columns for PC or laptop, 2 columns for tablet, and 1 column for phone
5. The color I use to most for my website is black with different opacity and level because the api I use have a lot of colorful img, so that with normal people it's UI and UX I believe is ok since it pretty symbol. For colorblindness people, they won't have to ask normal people about the color of the website since most of it is black, so they can use the website without worry about the color on the website
6. The first thing in my head to improve this project in the future is that when user hover their mouse to a specific game, it will play a video about that game, which will help the user a lot to choose the game they want to play. Because I use the free api key for this project, so it doesn't provide those video, but if I have more time may be I will find a way to do that like using some library as the find that video on Youtube, which will help me gain more experience in working with new library.
Second, that is build a detail page to show the specific game that user choose. Therefore, user can have more information about the game like its rating, story, image video game, platforms available for the game etc. For this, I will do by collecting the game id and name when user click, and use that to get the data from API for game detail. With this idea, it can help me have more experience in UI / UX and responsive design a new site, and also dealing with error when calling API
